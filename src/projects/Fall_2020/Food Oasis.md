## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Project Overview

<br/>

What if produce was no longer needed at grocery stores because it was grown in vertical towers?
Systemic racism in urban planning is limiting fresh food access to lower income communities. Cities must act to sustain adequate access in the future, especially in the event of a disaster where food delivery trucks are not able to get into the city. This will impact lower income communities the most, as it does in almost every societal emergency. Current zoning and planning inequities create food deserts in lower income and minority areas. Access to fresh, healthy food food becomes more difficult to access due to location and price, resulting in residents choosing readily available, cheaper fast food options that heavily populate these areas more often. This causes a prolonged negative effect on physical and mental health in these communities. In 2050, NYC will commit to providing healthy food to food deserts by creating a series of vertical agriculture through local developments. A block configuration will be developed to provide adequate access to fresh food in existing local food deserts. This will allow for increased self sufficient living, equal access to fresh food, and therefore increased health benefits.

### Goals and Metrics

1. ***usable garden space for planting:*** Plants require different amounts of space to grow into edible produce. We want to know how much of the space created by balconies, roofs of setbacks, stacking, and courtyards will actually be sufficient for growing food or will remain as regular green space or patio space.
1. ***garden sunlight hours:*** Some plants need a full day of sunlight, whereas some only need sunlight for a few hours of the day. Identifying the amount of sunlight hours for the gardens throughout the year will decide where and how much of each plant can be grown on the site.
1. ***tower to garden floor ratio:*** We need to make sure that the gardens are producing enough food for the people living there. Using the tower to garden floor ratio will show the relationship to number of residents to the amount of food grown, making it possible to determine if we are growing enough, too little, or need to sell or store food.
1. ***residential comfort:*** The amount of light used on the building to grow food will impact the comfort of the people that live there. We want to determine a building option that will still allow the people to be comfortable most of the time. If there is not a good degree of sunlight for the residents, we want to know how harmful it is.
1. ***access to amenities:*** Maintaining a garden at this scale can be on the labor intensive side. We want to provide the people with access to park space amenities as an alternative form of a green space to enjoy, increasing the mental and physical health of the residents.

We aim to find a model option that provides that fits these criteria without disadvantaging or inconveniencing any or too many residents.

*Percent black population*

Food deserts are when an area does not have close enough access to fresh food grocery stores. These often exist in lower income communities and are saturated with food swamps. This means that the area is filled with cheaper, fast food options, which draws in a lot of business from the community because they do not have the time, money, or enough opportunities to eat other healthier options.
The three main areas in NYC where food deserts exist are Harlem, South Bronx, and Brooklyn. As a result of lack of access to healthy and nutritious foods, these areas have higher rates of obesity than other parts of the city.
These effects stem from an old practice called redlining. This method was used by realtors which prevented black families from buying homes in certain areas. A continuing factor that leads to food deserts could be gentrification, a process that pushes low income residents out of their homes and forcing them to move to areas with lower, more affordable rent.
The demand for food in NYC is growing at 1.6% per year. The city highly relies on food distribution centers such as Hunts Point food distribution center. Only 4% of the food at the center is actually grown in New York. Due to the demand for food and systems of distribution, New York only ever has about 2-3 days of food on hand at one time. This puts the city at risk incase of some kind of unprecedented disaster, which always ends up impacting lower income communities the most. We want to help them stay prepared, self sustainable, and healthy.

### What Did We Discover?

Through the computational design model, we have identified that lower FAR and density that increases towards the north, and a diagonal street grid yield higher food production for residents and access to green spaces. This allows us to address the issues of providing self sufficient healthy food options to residents in food deserts,  while allowing access to additional outdoor recreational space and not just labor intensive space. This combination will help increase the overall physical and mental wellness of the block.

Each food and vegetable grown has different requirements for space needed to grow, depth of planting, growth yields produced, recommended amounts of plants per person, amount of sunlight needed to grow, and time of year to plant and harvest food. We will be narrowing our focus on the requirements for 3 vegetables to determine the metrics and the effectiveness of our model options.

*Procedural types and variations*


### Design Space

The design space has 5 inputs with 3 options for each input, creating 243 options. The street options are first, a traditional street grid that blended into its existing context. The second street option is a diagonal street that slightly created some difference from the adjacent blocks. The third street option is the most deviant, creating a radial street organization with smaller, triangular lots towards the center, and becoming more rectilinear on the perimeter. The street option inputs were varied in this way to see how accessibility to public spaces, light distribution, and building type would be affected by the block shapes and designated mobility on the ground. The minimum square footage requirement input has a range of 13000 to 18000 square feet and varies by 2500 square feet because that difference allows us to be able to see three different significant enough differences in building type and placement on the generated lots. The range does not go any lower as to provide lot options for the courtyard building type and does not go any higher due to the maximum lot size limit. The minimum square footage input for courtyards has a range of 2000 to 3000 square feet with increments of 500 square feet. This gives allows us to see change in distribution throughout the block and leaves some remaining space options for park amenity space. The FAR input has a range of 3-5 and increases by 1%. This allows us to see a low, medium, and high change in density and height on the block. The attraction type input specifies the how the building density is distributed throughout the site. It will also create the arrangement for the vertical profile of the site, which affects where more light can reach the gardens and grow certain foods. The density distributions are radial, coming from the north, and from the river. These will give options of orientations and lighting specific to the context as well as the design itself.

### Results

It was unexpected that a lower FAR would yield to higher food production. We expected taller buildings to be able to receive more light. However, the height of the buildings could cause more shadow on the lower buildings, resulting in more less productive surfaces overall. We also did not expect the diagonal and radial street orientations to produce more food than the typical straight street option. This could speak to the effectiveness of New York's city grid as a whole. It is efficient for transportation and organization, but possibly not for sustainable living. Some of the interior lighting data remained inconclusive in relation to the food production. The northern density distribution option tends to produce more food. The buildings increasing in height towards the north allows for more southern light on the rooftops. It also prevents any light getting blocked as the sun moves from east to west across the sky. The river orientation and the central orientation even more so, block light at certain times of the day. The combination with the highest food production used a diagonal street grid, 3 FAR, northern density distribution, 18000 sf for the tower minimum base (more roof space), and 2000 sf for the minimum courtyard area. The lowest production occurred with a straight street grid, 5 FAR, central density distribution, 13000 minimum sf base for the towers, and 3000 sf for the minimum courtyard area requirement.

*Comparing design results*

### Design Comparison

From the models we are able to compare how the different senarios are influencing the outcomes. The highest vegetable production is 27.7%, with the combination of radial street type, 18000 floor area, 2500 courtyard floor area, 3 FAR and northern density distribution. The lowest vegetable production is only 6.7%, with the combination of straight street grid, 13000 sf min tower base, 5 far, 3000 sf courtyard base, central density distribution.

The Tower to garden ratio fluctuate between 0.2 and 0.35. The highest senario is radial street, 13000 floor area, 3 FAR, 3000 min sf, center attraction, and the lowest is straight grid street, 15500 floor area, 5 FAR, 2000 min sf for courtyard, and river attraction type. The garden area senario is 18000 floor area, 3 FAR, 3000 min sf courtyard, central density distribution, and the lowest is diagonal street, 13000 floor area, 5 far, 2000 min sf courtyard and river attraction type.

### Conclusions and Next Steps

The results of this project can be used to guide urban projects that hopes to have vertial garden space, and to maximize the grden space per user. Also this project hope to call for more attention to urban security issue. Current urban rooftop space can be utilized to create gardens, and zooning codes that control new building construction can adject to optimize the potential for buildings to provide more garden spaces. However, the model has limited exploration on how different tower form are influencing outdoor garden sapce, and that's what we can further work on in the future.
