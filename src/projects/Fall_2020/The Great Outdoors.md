## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Project Overview

<br />



***In the wake of a global pandemic, communities desperately seek out public areas, particularly open space. Yet, the overall activity for the city lagged.***

“What if, the higher population area required different public space types?”
```

“What if, increased area of public spaces are fragmented and temporarily privatized through carving out of the existing cities blocks?”

### Goals and Metrics

***Metrics***

1. Walkability Analysis: number of outdoor dining within 8min walk
2. Daylight Analysis: avergae daylight hour for analysid area
3. Building Compactness Analysis: surface area to volume ratio

***Goal***

To understand how cityscape as dense and developed as New York could adapt to changing need of public in order to increase over all activity. Evaluate the successfulness of city streets in contemporary as well as future times. Explore how public spaces can reshape the urban fabric/layout.

The sunlight exposure will be based on seasons within the year the average sunlight more than 6-hours exposure community will be determined as a comfortable community
The thermal analysis will indicates level of Comfort
The activiites and walkability will help us to utilize the street spaces by pedestrians and adjacent tenants as well as activities within larger context.

***We expect to find a comfortable community or a urban context needs at least 6 hours sunlight exposure, the enough public space as well as the different programs to meet the requirment. Moreover, the public space accessible within 10 mins based on different walkability path.*** 


### What Did We Discover?

At different population density area, the public space programs would be divided into five different types to meet our goal.

```
“Through the computational design model, we have identified urban population density and public space numbers trends that allows the city
to address the social distancing and shortage of public space programs while achieving or increasing sunlight exposure and public accessbility.”
```

In New York, Full block implementation saw higher levels of activity (78%) than “Open Restaurant” street (62%) and far higher level of activity compared to “Protected Bike Lane” street (51%)


In 2050, city of New York commits to have its first neighborhood designed to let people experience the GREAT Outdoors during the Pandemic.

### Procedural Types

We defined the five different procedural types for public space program.
They are restricted by the urban density and building height.

***Procedural type rule***


Outdoor Performance, the building height below 120 feet with low population density.
  
Outdoor Eating, the building height below 120 feet with mid population density.

Urban Roof Garden, the building height is equal to 120 feet with high population density.

Dog Park, the building height is higher than 200 feet with mid population density.

Bar/ Barbeque Area, the building height is higher than 200 feet with high population density.

### Design Space

"I’m varying this input in this range because of street pattern and population density."

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Analysis and Results

<br />

### Exploring the Design Space

This section should be descriptive of your team's design exploration and initial insights using Scout. 

***Each team will be conducting a live demonstration of your model in Scout when presenting final project.***

Additionally, teams will be required to document their live demo on GitHub with annotated, sequential screenshots replicating the sequence of the live demonstration. Show how you can use Scout to explore scenarios or answer specific questions using the parallel coordinates chart.

```
For example,
“What if’s . . .”
```

### Results

Were certain metrics inconclusive? Were there unexpected correlations? What are the GENERAL trends in your data? What are your SPECIFIC insights/findings? You can annotate right on top of Scout screenshots or translate insights to diagrams. How does performance (metrics) relate to form (inputs)?

![description]()
*Please include a short caption describing your diagram.*

### Design Comparison

Create an image comparing several options that are representative of the trends in your analysis. This should include high and low-performing options, options that perform well in some metrics but poorly in others, options that do a good job of balancing trade-offs, etc. Include text explaining the comparison image and key take-aways. Include an option that gives context to the performance as a baseline or a benchmark. For example, it could be the existing context or an option with your target density but with traditional development patterns (i.e., densification without design innovation.)

Make sure to include both images and the data. Provide a visual hierarchy so that we can see which data are most relevant, which are high vs.  low. These can be simple charts, or even just text. Focus on clearly communicating the data. 

Zoom in to talk about the best option(s) and the worst. Take a few images to detail why these options perform well or poorly. The point of this entire exercise is to create a data-driven methodology for making DECISIONS, so choose which option or options are the best and defend those choices.

### Conclusions and Next Steps

For the concluding text of your computational design model documentation, think about the following questions as you reinforce the reason why the results your team's model should implemented.

1. How do you recommend the results of your model be used? Who should learn from this?
***The model result could be used for researches and scientists who would like to study the extreme condition that high density area with public space intervention urban type***
***The Department of City Planning (DCP)***
***CDC WHO***
***Urban design lab***
2. If we are treating this as a proof-of-concept to illustrate the viability of this type of computational approach to the city, what are the next steps for implementation?
***We challenge how the buildings and public shared spaces are planned and designed separatly. We would recommend the results of the model to the District Community Council. The public space for city-use should be included as an essential part of the architectural design. ***
***To calculate the budget, the construction phases, and the influences to the existing urban context***
3. Your project evaluation relative to the anti-bias rubric we developed. These include identifying limitations, what this does and does not do or include.
****Limitation: the model only suit for the high density urban area, and particilarlly, during the post COVID19 era. It could carry the further concept and meaning if the model type suit for different urban condition that we would like to challeng the relationship of public space and highrise buildings***
