## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Project Overview

<br />



***In the wake of a global pandemic, communities desperately seek out public areas, particularly open space. Yet, the overall activity for the city lagged.***

### Goals and Metrics

***Metrics***

1. Walkability Analysis: number of outdoor dining within 8min walk
2. Daylight Analysis: avergae daylight hour for analysid area
3. Building Compactness Analysis: surface area to volume ratio

***Goal***

1.Understand how a cityscape as dense and developed as New York could adapt to the changing need for public space under the Pandemic. 

2.Explore how public spaces can reshape the urban fabric/layout.

3.Evaluate the successfulness of public space in contemporary as well as future times. 

4.Suggest how future city residents could adapt their daily habits to the rapidly changing public space environments. 


### What Did We Discover?

At different population density area, the public space programs would be divided into five different types to meet our goal.

```
“Through the computational design model, we have identified urban population density and public space numbers trends that allows the city
to address the social distancing and shortage of public space programs while achieving or increasing sunlight exposure and public accessbility.”
```

In New York, Full block implementation saw higher levels of activity (78%) than “Open Restaurant” street (62%) and far higher level of activity compared to “Protected Bike Lane” street (51%)


## In 2050, city of New York commits to have its first neighborhood designed to let people experience the GREAT Outdoors during the Pandemic. ##

### Procedural Types

We defined the five different procedural types for public space program.
They are restricted by the urban density and building height.

***Procedural type rule***


Outdoor Performance, the building height below 120 feet with low population density.
  
Outdoor Eating, the building height below 120 feet with low population density.

Urban Roof Garden, the building height is between 120-200 feet with mid population density.

Dog Park, the building height is higher than 200 feet with high population density.

Bar/ Barbeque Area, the building height is higher than 200 feet with high population density.

### Design Space

```
"I’m varying this input in this range because of street pattern and population density."

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Analysis and Results

<br />

### Exploring the Design Space

This section should be descriptive of your team's design exploration and initial insights using Scout. 

***Each team will be conducting a live demonstration of your model in Scout when presenting final project.***

Additionally, teams will be required to document their live demo on GitHub with annotated, sequential screenshots replicating the sequence of the live demonstration. Show how you can use Scout to explore scenarios or answer specific questions using the parallel coordinates chart.

```
For example,
“What if’s . . .”
```

### Results

We found that the greater the building compactness, the worse for the walkability.
The higher density the daylight could have different performance, because it realted to the building compactness and street options

### Design Comparison

***Walkability***

Worst - We discovered that the typical New York street grid is most inefficient at connecting adjacent attraction points; in our case, we measured the accessibility to out-door dining type with in 10 minutes walking radius. Scenario 1, with high vertical travel distance caused by high population density, produced a situation where residents on average will only access 3.6 restaurants within 10 minutes.


![description](https://github.com/tterrytang/XIM-GSAPP-Fa20/blob/main/src/images/worse.gif)

Best - The best scenario for walking around our future mega block is in fact a centralized street grid system. With more than four side intersections matched with a lower population density, the average number of outdoor dining locations a resident enjoy on a typical day is high in the 40s (48.3)

![description](https://github.com/tterrytang/XIM-GSAPP-Fa20/blob/main/src/images/best.gif)



***Compactness***

As the type of public space directly affects our building typology, we took into account the efficiency of building by measuring their compactness, expressed through a ratio (SA/VOL). 



Worst - While compactness is measured in relation to its own, we noticed that building with lower height is most inefficient as site footprint has not been maximized to achieve most volume.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Best - Contrary, although higher buildings, those with more population density needs, take longer to travel (vertically); they are highly efficient as surface area is minimized while volume is maximized. However, public space type-bar requires more surface area due to its nesting nature and must be considered matching its building performance efficiencies

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sunlight(Diversity)**

Measuring each public space type independently from one another, we were able to identify best, worst case while understanding the diversity element of each design space. For example, we found that in one scenario although both public spaces (performance and outdoor dining) are receiving adequate sunlight the diversity among public space types is low. 


![description](https://github.com/tterrytang/XIM-GSAPP-Fa20/blob/main/src/images/L_Low.gif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![description](https://github.com/tterrytang/XIM-GSAPP-Fa20/blob/main/src/images/L_High.gif)


When diversity is increased, that is when population density is increased and population variation is high, each public space receive less sunlight as building blocks become less uniformly distributed and more subjected to shadows.





***Inclusion we present the scenario with high public space type variation and most adequate sunlight received by not one, but all spaces. The scenario below perform the best when accessibility and compactness are both considered.***



### Conclusions and Next Steps


***The model result could be used for researches and scientists who would like to study the extreme condition that high density area with public space intervention urban type***

Such as 
The Department of City Planning (DCP)

CDC

WHO

Urban design lab


We challenge how the buildings and public shared spaces are planned and designed separately. We would recommend the results of the model to the District Community Council. The public space for city-use should be included as an essential part of the architectural design


To calculate the budget, the construction phases, and the influences to the existing urban context


Limitation: the model only suit for the high density urban area, and particularly, during the post COVID19 era. It could carry the further concept and meaning if the model type suit for different urban condition that we would like to challenge the relationship of public space and highrise buildings
