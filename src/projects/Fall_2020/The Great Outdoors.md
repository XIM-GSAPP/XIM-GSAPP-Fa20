The introduction image indicates how the design of computational model influences and reshapes the New York city fabric in the future scenario.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Project Overview

<br />



***In the wake of a global pandemic, communities desperately seek out public areas, particularly open space. Yet, the overall activity for the city lagged.***

“What if, more outdoor seating is obtained through converting the motorway into recreational spaces?”
```

```
“What if, the higher population area required different public space types?”
```

```
“What if, increased area of public spaces are fragmented and temporarily privatized through carving out of the existing cities blocks?”

### Goals and Metrics

***Metrics***

1. Walkability Analysis: number of outdoor dining within 8min walk
2. Daylight Analysis: avergae daylight hour for analysid area
3. Building Compactness Analysis: surface area to volume ratio

***Goal***

1.Understand how a cityscape as dense and developed as New York could adapt to the changing need for public space under the Pandemic. 

2.Explore how public spaces can reshape the urban fabric/layout.

3.Evaluate the successfulness of public space in contemporary as well as future times. 

4.Suggest how future city residents could adapt their daily habits to the rapidly changing public space environments. 


### What Did We Discover?

At different population density area, the public space programs would be divided into five different types to meet our goal.

```
“Through the computational design model, we have identified urban population density and public space numbers trends that allows the city
to address the social distancing and shortage of public space programs while achieving or increasing sunlight exposure and public accessbility.”
```

In New York, Full block implementation saw higher levels of activity (78%) than “Open Restaurant” street (62%) and far higher level of activity compared to “Protected Bike Lane” street (51%)


In 2050, city of New York commits to have its first neighborhood designed to let people experience the GREAT Outdoors during the Pandemic.

### Procedural Types

We defined the five different procedural types for public space program.
They are restricted by the urban density and building height.

***Procedural type rule***


Outdoor Performance, the building height below 120 feet with low population density.
  
Outdoor Eating, the building height below 120 feet with low population density.

Urban Roof Garden, the building height is between 120-200 feet with mid population density.

Dog Park, the building height is higher than 200 feet with high population density.

Bar/ Barbeque Area, the building height is higher than 200 feet with high population density.

### Design Space

```
"I’m varying this input in this range because of street pattern and population density."
```

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Analysis and Results

<br />

### Exploring the Design Space

This section should be descriptive of your team's design exploration and initial insights using Scout. 

***Each team will be conducting a live demonstration of your model in Scout when presenting final project.***

Additionally, teams will be required to document their live demo on GitHub with annotated, sequential screenshots replicating the sequence of the live demonstration. Show how you can use Scout to explore scenarios or answer specific questions using the parallel coordinates chart.

```
For example,
“What if’s . . .”
```

### Results

We found that the greater the building compactness, the worse for the walkability.
The higher density the daylight could have different performance, because it realted to the building compactness and street options

### Design Comparison

Create an image comparing several options that are representative of the trends in your analysis. This should include high and low-performing options, options that perform well in some metrics but poorly in others, options that do a good job of balancing trade-offs, etc. Include text explaining the comparison image and key take-aways. Include an option that gives context to the performance as a baseline or a benchmark. For example, it could be the existing context or an option with your target density but with traditional development patterns (i.e., densification without design innovation.)

Make sure to include both images and the data. Provide a visual hierarchy so that we can see which data are most relevant, which are high vs.  low. These can be simple charts, or even just text. Focus on clearly communicating the data. 

Zoom in to talk about the best option(s) and the worst. Take a few images to detail why these options perform well or poorly. The point of this entire exercise is to create a data-driven methodology for making DECISIONS, so choose which option or options are the best and defend those choices.

### Conclusions and Next Steps


***The model result could be used for researches and scientists who would like to study the extreme condition that high density area with public space intervention urban type***

Such as 
***The Department of City Planning (DCP)***

***CDC*** 

***WHO***

***Urban design lab***


***We challenge how the buildings and public shared spaces are planned and designed separately. We would recommend the results of the model to the District Community Council. The public space for city-use should be included as an essential part of the architectural design***


***To calculate the budget, the construction phases, and the influences to the existing urban context***


****Limitation: the model only suit for the high density urban area, and particularly, during the post COVID19 era. It could carry the further concept and meaning if the model type suit for different urban condition that we would like to challenge the relationship of public space and highrise buildings***
