# (Project Title)

## Intro 

### Thesis Statement / Daring Question

### Photo Collage that is illustrative of the outcome of your project. 

For example, if your question was, “What if all park space was equitably distributed?” then you might take a google earth image of Manhattan and photoshop buildings in place of Central Park and many small parks scattered throughout the borough. 

### Goals 

Sentence 2-4 

### Metrics 

These section should describe how you are to determine success through your metrics. 

1. What are you measuring? 
1. Why you are measuring it? 
1. How it relates to your goals.

### Summary of conclusions and takeaways. 

For example, “Through the computational design model we have identified X and Y trends that allows the city to address Z while achieving or increasing A and B.” Get the reader excited about understanding your project by stating the outcome up front, then the rest of the post / presentation is illustrating how you got there. Use the background research and mapping explain why the outcome of your model is important:
Background research for your prompt, creating a future context and/or how you developed custom metrics.
Urban data mapping, exploration and transformation of NYC into a future condition (if needed.)

## Computational Design Model

### Overview of Model:

inputs, procedural types, size and metrics. Make a clear, easily read diagram.
Analysis tools: how you are deriving your metric, link to any packaged analysis tools you have posted.
Have a summary slide with each analysis tool, use a slide for each custom tool that requires further explanation on how it works.
Procedural types: the rules you have defined, range of variability and an explanation of how they relate to you goals and metrics.
Design space: input ranges and why you picked that range and what you left out (I’m varying this input in this range because of X,) simple diagram(s) that illustrate extremes of the design space, animated gif of design space and computational model table.

### Analysis and Results
Explore: Scout as a Tool: Design exploration and initial insights + trade-offs (detailed in next step.) Live demo when presenting. Annotated, sequential screenshots replicating the sequence of the live demo documented in GitHub. Show how you can use Scout to explore scenarios or answer specific questions using the parallel coordinates chart. “What if’s . . .”

Summarize: Specific Trends, insights and trade-offs. You can annotate right on top of Scout screenshots or translate insights to diagrams.
Conclusions and next steps. 
How do you recommend the results of your model be used? Who should learn from this?
If we are treating this as a proof-of-concept to illustrate the viability of this type of computational approach to the city, what are the next steps for implementation? 
Your project evaluated relative to the anti-bias rubric we developed. Including identifying limitations, what this does and does not do or include.
