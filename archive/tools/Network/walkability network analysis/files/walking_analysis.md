### Description

<The analysis tool included the different buildings distance to the public space, not only the horizontal, but also the vertical network through building to public space programs, there are four different aspects this analysis involved in, the pictures indicated above>


### How To Use

<b>Step by Step Instructions:</b>


1. Right click on "population density" -> Select different density options.
2. Right click on "buildings" -> Select Multiple and select buildings.
3. Right click on "public space program points" -> Select Multiple and select the distance you want to test.
4. Adjust Threshold X,Y,Z
5. Review visual and metric outputs. Does it look correct? Does something look wrong? Common issues below.

#### Troubleshooting

Make sure that the distance has to start with 0. 
Make sure select the point as the start point, or the building as the start point for network analysis
