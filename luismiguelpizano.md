The Bronx has a checkered development history. As a result of the fires that eroded much of the borough in the 70s and 80s, the built fabric of the Bronx is today extremely uneven in terms of its lot usage. This presents an opportunity for more inventive strategies of urban design, as the Bronx faces increasing density and pollution pressures. How can designers better understand these new pressures on the city and generate protocols which redistribute parks, housing and industry according to new targets of equity and health. 

If the Bronx continues to grow through the construction of mid-sized buildings that are positioned next to new sources of pollution - rather than through strategic verticality positioned close to parks and away from industry - the historically environmentally burdened population of Mott Haven, Melrose, and the Bronx more broadly will continue to experience a declining quality of life. 

In line with the Fourth Regional Plan, this project seeks to "ensure [that] all housing is healthy" which will require the "transformation of historically environmentally burdened neighborhoods into healthy communities by reducing pollution from ports, airports, trucks, and highways, and transitioning from polluting energy sources," and to "Connect urban neighborhoods with parks and greenery and an easily accessible regional trail network to allow everyone to benefit from the region’s open spaces and natural beauty."
